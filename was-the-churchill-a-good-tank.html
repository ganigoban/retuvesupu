<time>08 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><span><span>It was a tank that was noted for <b>poor mechanical reliability</b>. It was used alongside Mark IIs and IIIs with Canadian forces on the Dieppe Raid and in Tunisia; some were still in use late in the war in Italy on the Gothic Line.</span></span><h2>What was the best British tank of ww2?</h2>Britain's belated equivalent, the Cromwell, was outmoded by the time it entered service. Its more powerful successor, the Comet, was certainly the best British tank of the war, but only saw action in the last weeks of hostilities. The Centurion would have been a game changer, but belongs to the post-war world.<h2>What was the best Churchill tank?</h2>The Mark IV was perhaps the most prolific Churchill tank and probably saw the most combat of any model. It was armed with either a six-pounder or a 75-mm gun. The tank weighed 39 tons, had a top speed of 27 km (17 miles) per hour, and a range of 145 km (90 miles).<h2>Which was the best tank in ww2?</h2>Though later tanks produced during this time period proved to have better armor and armament, the T-34 is often recognized as the most effective, highly influential and efficient tank design of WWII.<h2>Did Churchill help invent the tank?</h2>Although Churchill did not “invent” the tank, he was by far the most significant supporter of its development during World War I.<h2>German Thoughts on the Churchill Tank</h2><p></p><h2>Could a Churchill beat a tiger?</h2>In one encounter, on 21 April 1943, during the start of the Battle of Longstop Hill, a Churchill tank of the 48th Royal Tank Regiment got the better of a German Tiger I heavy tank. A 6 pounder shot from the Churchill lodged between the Tiger's turret and turret ring, jamming the turret and injuring the German crew.<h2>How many Churchill tanks were lost?</h2>On the Western Front in 1944–1945, 4,477 British Commonwealth tanks were destroyed, including 2,712 M4 Sherman tanks, 656 Churchill tanks, 609 Cromwell tanks, 433 M3 Stuart light tanks, 39 Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger tanks, 26 Comet tanks, 2 M24 Chaffee light tanks. ~10,000 tanks/SPGs/tank destroyers lost.<h2>Who had better tanks in ww2?</h2>The German Tiger tank (above) had a more powerful main gun, heavier armor, and wider tracks than the American Sherman tank (below). The German 88 is more powerful than any American tank gun used during the course of most of the war.<h2>What is the best tank in history?</h2>The Leopard 2 is thought to be one of the most accurate and efficient tanks in the world. It has outperformed the American Abrams, British Challenger 2 and other tanks in various tests and is capable of firing accurately and over long distances thanks to its turret design and advanced control systems.<h2>Could a Sherman tank destroy a Panzer?</h2>No Sherman could—on paper at least—stand up to a Panther, but the U.S. had the priceless advantage of supporting airpower, plentiful reserves, and an overwhelming superiority of numbers.<h2>Was the Cromwell tank any good?</h2>The tank was praised for its speed and reliability, while its low profile made it harder to spot. The standard 75mm gun could tackle the majority of German armoured vehicles, and the HE shell was effective, but could not penetrate the front of heavier German tanks such as the Tiger or Panther.<h2>How good was the British Comet tank?</h2>It is regarded as one of the best British tanks of the war, continuing in service until the 1950s and it played a key role in the development of the later Centurion tank[1]. The Comet is held in such high regard for its cost effectiveness, speed, and low profile compared to other models at the time.<h2>What was the best German tank in ww2?</h2>The Panther is often believed to be the best German tank of the Second World War. When the Germans invaded Russia in June 1941, they were surprised by the quantity and quality of Soviet armour. Hitler ordered that the T-34 be copied and the result was the Panther, which saw action for the first time at Kursk in 1943.<h2>What tank has the most kills?</h2>Legacy. With 168 confirmed (possibly as high as 195) kills, Knispel was by far the most successful tanker of the Second World War and is even credited with knocking out a T-34 at 3,000 metres (3,300 yd). He fought in virtually every type of German tank as loader, gunner and commander.<h2>Why was Britain so weak in WW2?</h2>financial restrictions and treaties resulted in the Royal Navy being unprepared for a future war. it lacked destroyers and aircraft carriers. many of the major warships lacked defences against air attack.<h2>Was the Panther tank better than the Tiger?</h2>The Panther was a compromise. While having essentially the same Maybach V12 petrol (690 hp) engine as the Tiger I, it had better gun penetration, was lighter and faster, and could traverse rough terrain better than the Tiger I. The trade-off was weaker side armour, which made it vulnerable to flanking fire.<h2>What was the most feared tank of WW2?</h2>Germany's Tiger tank, whether in the form of the Tiger I or later Tiger II (King Tiger), was the most feared tank of WWII.<h2>Which country had the best tanks?</h2><p>Currently top 10 best tanks in the world are these:</p><li>Nr.1 Leopard 2A7 (Germany) ...</li><li>Nr.2 K2 Black Panther (South Korea) ...</li><li>Nr.3 M1A2 SEP (USA) ...</li><li>Nr.4 Challenger 2 (United Kingdom) ...</li><li>Nr.5 Armata (Russia) ...</li><li>Nr.6 Merkava Mk.4 (Israel) ...</li><li>Nr.7 Type 90 (Japan) ...</li><li>Nr.8 Leclerc (France)</li><h2>Did the US have a heavy tank in WWII?</h2>Near the end of the war, the M26 Pershing tank was deployed as the first operational heavy tank of the US Army. It was designated a heavy tank when it was designed in WWII due to its 90 mm gun, which was at the time the largest caliber gun found on a US tank.<h2>Were German tanks reliable?</h2>The Germans started the war with good, reliable tanks, and guns that were often slightly underpowered. But due to the demands of the battlefield, later in the war they often rushed production of heavier tanks with a load of mechanical problems.<h2>Was the British Army good in ww2?</h2>British artillery in Northwestern Europe was crushingly superior to the German's, although it did not become truly devastating until late 1944, based off Operational Research demonstrating the inaccuracy and mixed results of indirect fire artillery bombardments in Normandy.<h2>Why does Britain have so few tanks?</h2>The British Army hasn't bought significant numbers of heavy armored vehicles in a generation. Financial problems, neglect at the political level and the distraction of low-intensity foreign wars together deprived the army of the resources it needed to upgrade or replace existing equipment.<h2>How good was the Tiger tank?</h2>The Tiger was one of the most feared weapons of World War Two. In addition to it's near-impervious armour, it could also destroy an enemy tank from over a mile away, and on the right terrrain, was highly effective, causing the Allies to devote considerable time to tracking their movements.<h2>What was the best Russian tank of ww2?</h2>The T-34 is a Soviet medium tank produced from 1940 to 1958. It was the world's best tank when the Soviet Union entered the Second World War, and although its armour and armament were surpassed by later WWII tanks, it is credited as the war's most effective, efficient and influential design.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9aaqmasmJp6pLTUq5qhoZyheqJ5xqimnWWklrus</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwas-the-churchill-a-good-tank.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwas-the-churchill-a-good-tank.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwas-the-churchill-a-good-tank.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwas-the-churchill-a-good-tank.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwas-the-churchill-a-good-tank.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwas-the-churchill-a-good-tank.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-does-the-pigs-head-symbolize-in-lord-of-the-flies-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-does-the-pigs-head-symbolize-in-lord-of-the-flies-html.html>What does the pigs head symbolize in Lord of the Flies?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./victoria-clark-net-worth-64709.html>Victoria Clark Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./victoria-clark-net-worth-64709.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
