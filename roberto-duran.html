Duran’s net worth should be substantially higher, but he reportedly spent more than $20 million during the height of his success on a luxury lifestyle.</p><p>During his second-longest career, he won world championships in the lightweight, welterweight, light middleweight, and middleweight divisions. Durán retired for good in early 2002, following an automobile accident in Argentina.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Roberto Duran?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Roberto Duran</a> was born on June 16, 1951, in Guararé, Panama, to Panamanian mother Clara and American father Margarito, who was from Arizona and of Mexican ancestry. He was reared in Panama City’s Corregimiento El Chorrillo, where he began sparring with boxers at the age of eight. Durán went on to participate in amateur boxing until he was sixteen.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How old is Roberto Duran?</h2><p>He is currently 72 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Roberto Duran’s net worth?</h2><p>He is estimated to be worth $3 Million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Roberto Duran’s career?</h2><p>Durán debuted professionally as a lightweight boxer in February 1968. He won his first 31 contests, advancing to his first title bout in June 1972. Durán won the WBA lightweight belt that night by defeating Ken Buchanan.</p><p>He successfully defended the championship 12 times, defeating opponents such as Jimmy Robertson, Hector Thompson, and Guts Ishimatsu. Durán last defended his championship in 1978, defeating Esteban De Jesús before losing it in early 1979.</p><p>Durán won over Carlos Palomino and Zeferino Gonzales after moving up to welterweight, opening the stage for a title battle against Sugar Ray Leonard, the then-undefeated WBC welterweight champion.</p><p>Durán won the WBC welterweight title by unanimous decision against Leonard in the hugely publicized bout, dubbed as the “Brawl in Montreal,” held at the Olympic Stadium in Montreal. However, in a rematch in New Orleans later that year, Leonard defeated Durán after the latter abruptly stopped fighting at the end of the eighth round, purportedly saying “no más” many times. Durán made his first boxing retirement following that fight.</p><p>Durán finally came back from retirement to compete in the light middleweight division. In early 1982, he made an unsuccessful maiden attempt at the WBC light middleweight championship. Durán then signed with promoter Bob Arum and began planning his big comeback. He went on to defeat former world champion José Cuevas, earning himself another opportunity at the light middleweight belt. Durán ultimately won the championship in 1983, on his 32nd birthday, by defeating Davey Moore.</p><p>A year later, however, he was stripped of the championship after the WBA rejected his fight with WBC champion Thomas Hearns. The battle was infamous since it was Durán’s first knockout in his career.</p><p>He then retired for the second time, but later changed his mind and returned to the ring in early 1986. Durán did not compete for another title until 1989 when he faced Iran Barkley for the WBC middleweight belt. Durán won the epic match by a split decision, earning his fourth career title.</p><p>Durán stepped up to super middleweight in late 1989 for his third career fight against Sugar Ray Leonard. He eventually lost and didn’t fight again until 1991. Durán’s second title fight came against Vinny Pazienza in 1994, for the IBC super middleweight belt. Pazienza won by unanimous decision and then again in a rematch in early 1995. A few years later, Durán challenged WBA middleweight champion William Joppy, who defeated him in three rounds.</p><p>Durán retired for the third time in his career as a result of such a crushing defeat. He eventually changed his mind and returned to the ring in 1999. Durán eventually defeated Pat Lawlor to win the NBA super middleweight title in 2000. The next year, in what would be the final fight of his career, he lost the title to Héctor Camacho.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqumm52iqbxusNSrmKdn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2froberto-duran.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2froberto-duran.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2froberto-duran.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2froberto-duran.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2froberto-duran.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2froberto-duran.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./are-pea-flakes-good-for-guinea-pigs.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./are-pea-flakes-good-for-guinea-pigs.html>Are pea flakes good for guinea pigs?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./alia-zuidema-obituary-michigan-resident-and-grand-haven-member.html>Alia Zuidema Obituary, Michigan Resident and Grand Haven Member</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./alia-zuidema-obituary-michigan-resident-and-grand-haven-member.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
