The star became one of the most famous child actors in the game thanks to big roles on both the big and small screens and even landed in the <a href=#>Guinness World Records</a> after a 2010 study found her to be the <a href=#>highest paid TV child actress</a> per episode. The then-16-year-old made a whopping $180,000 for every episode of <a href=#>Nickelodeon's</a> <a href=#>iCarly</a>.</p><p>But that was far from Cosgrove's only big role. Fans may also recognize her as the studious Summer in Jack Black's&nbsp;School of Rock, Drake's scheming younger sister in Nickelodeon's Drake & Josh, or even the voice of the older sister Margo in the Despicable Me movies. But it's not just acting where Cosgrove hit the big time. The star also has impressive pipes and released the album Sparks Fly in 2010, which featured the hit single "Kissin U."</p><p>When she's not hitting the headlines for her work though, it's her dating life that's making news. Read on to find out about Cosgrove's most famous exes.</p><h2>Miranda Cosgrove got cozy with an iCarly co-star</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/who-are-miranda-cosgroves-famous-exes/miranda-cosgrove-got-cozy-with-an-icarly-co-star-1618092984.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images</span><p>Miranda Cosgrove was romantically linked to one of her iCarly co-stars between 2007 and 2009, as she famously dated actor and musician James Maslow who starred in one episode of the show as Shane. Fans will also recognize the star as James Diamond in Big Time Rush, or from his stint on Season 18 of Dancing With the Stars or Season 1 of <a href=#>Celebrity Big Brother</a>.</p><p>The couple didn't flaunt their relationship in the public eye, though <a href=#>J-14</a> reported that they dated for almost two years, first getting together in March 2007 but splitting in February 2009. Not much is known about their time together, unfortunately, especially considering this was a time before the social media boom. They also appear to have managed to keep things cordial after their split as they run in a lot of the same circles. Maslow sweetly <a href=#>presented Cosgrove with the Crossover of the Year Award</a> at the 2012 Young Hollywood Awards.</p><h2>Nat Wolff and Miranda Cosgrove had a long-term romance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/who-are-miranda-cosgroves-famous-exes/nat-wolff-and-miranda-cosgrove-had-a-long-term-romance-1618092984.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</span><p>Miranda Cosgrove and The Naked Brothers Band star Nat Wolff are thought to have gotten pretty serious, with Cosgrove hinting that they dated for around three years. The two sparked dating rumors when they were spotted together leaving a concert in 2010, though the star played down the romance speculation, telling <a href=#>Tiger Beat</a> in June 2010 that they were "close friends" and she thought Wolff was "great."&nbsp;</p><p>Though they kept their romance on the down low, Cosgrove did open up a little bit about their private life together when she spoke about an important relationship then ended with a bad breakup. The actor didn't name names, but did admit the guy she was talking about was someone she met at work, and both famously worked at Nickelodeon.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking in the March 2011 issue of&nbsp;<a href=#>Seventeen</a> (via People), Cosgrove revealed that she had "only had one serious boyfriend, but we dated for three years," and shared that they "broke up not that long ago." Cosgrove continued, "He's the one guy I really, really liked. People say they have that one person they never forget â€” I feel like that. Even though we don't talk too much anymore, he'll be the one who got away."&nbsp;She added that she was dating again but hadn't totally got over their relationship.</p><h2>Miranda Cosgrove and Max Ehrich were rumored to have gotten close</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/who-are-miranda-cosgroves-famous-exes/miranda-cosgrove-and-max-ehrich-were-rumored-to-have-gotten-close-1618092984.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Shutterstock</span><p>Miranda Cosgrove is rumored to have had a brief romance with actor Max Ehrich, who was <a href=#>famously engaged to Demi Lovato</a> before they <a href=#>called off their relationship</a> in dramatic fashion after a whirlwind few months in 2020. The rumors began circulating after Ehrich appeared in a 2010 episode of iCarly and he and Cosgrove later went to the movies together, though he played coy when asked about his dating life in a since-deleted December 2010 interview with Access Hollywood. "We are really good friends. We really are. We're very young. Why be tied down?" Ehrich said. "Whenever you're hanging out with someone, you're dating. You're married! People just have these hypotheses."</p><p>Two years later, the two had people talking again when <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> published candid photos of Cosgrove and the Young and the Restless&nbsp;and Under the Dome actor out on walking together Hollywood on a November 2012 evening.</p><h2>Noah Centineo and Miranda Cosgrove may have had a romantic spark</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/who-are-miranda-cosgroves-famous-exes/noah-centineo-and-miranda-cosgrove-may-have-had-a-romantic-spark-1618092984.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Shutterstock</span><p>Though Miranda Cosgrove clearly likes to keep her relationships private, she did appear to be a little more public with <a href=#>Noah Centineo</a> before he found fame with To All the Boys I've Loved Before. The two never confirmed if they actually dated, though they had rumors swirling back in June 2013 when they attended the premiere of Despicable Me 2 together. Cosgrove even posted a photo of them together alongside a female friend on her <a href=#>Instagram</a> account.</p><p>The snap, which is still up as of April 2021, showed the trio wearing black framed glasses as they sat together at a round table. Cosgrove looked stunning a blue dress with gold accents, while Centineo went more casual in a gray t-shirt and backwards baseball cap. Cosgrove didn't give much away in the caption, simply writing, "At the Despicable Me 2 premiere <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wp.looper.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:) style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> ." The snap was posted two months after the duo were spotted looking pretty couple-y at a Lakers Game in photos published by <a href=#>Got Celeb</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG9paoBye9ahpmaZopp6rrXRmqWdmV2YvLSz0aitnqtdm66uu9SsZJ6wlah8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-miranda-cosgroves-famous-exes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-are-miranda-cosgroves-famous-exes.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-miranda-cosgroves-famous-exes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-are-miranda-cosgroves-famous-exes.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-miranda-cosgroves-famous-exes.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-miranda-cosgroves-famous-exes.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-captain-dibya-shankar-mishra-wife-priyanka-agasti-mla-ets-engaged-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-captain-dibya-shankar-mishra-wife-priyanka-agasti-mla-ets-engaged-html.html>Who Is Captain Dibya Shankar Mishra Wife Priyanka Agasti?
