The Duke of Sussex flew into London especially to attend the WellChild Awards, an annual event that honors sick children, their families, and caregivers.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s so good to be here; I’ve been looking forward to it, it’s very special to me,” he said as he arrived at London’s Hurlingham Club for the September 7 event. “[Duchess Meghan] is sad she can’t be here.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harry did not attend the 2022 charity event, as his grandmother <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a38038396/queen-elizabeth-ii-died-age-96/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Queen Elizabeth II passed away" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Queen Elizabeth II passed away</a> at age 96 on that same day. In his speech to guests, the duke honored the late monarch: “As you know, I was unable to attend [last year] … As you also probably know, she would have been the first person to insist I still come to be with you all instead of going to her, and that’s precisely why I know, exactly one year on, she is looking down on all of us tonight—happy we are together—continuing to spotlight such an incredible community.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Before attending the ceremony, Harry spent an hour at a private reception meeting the young winners and adult caregivers receiving awards. Sitting down with seven-year-old Poppy, Harry joked that he looked “a bit like” Ed Sheeran after the girl said she was in the mood to dance to the singer’s music. “Are you ready for a boogie?” the prince asked, laughing. Poppy may be young, but she is fully committed to helping her older sister Paige, 17, who suffers from severe epilepsy and hyperinsulinism—it’s why she was presented with the Caring Child Award. “You know you’re very special, don’t you?” Harry told her. “And I love your dress. The whole look is fantastic.”</p><img alt="wellchild awards 2023, in association with gsk at the hurlingham club, london winner poppy higham with prince harry 79 2023picture by antony thompson" title="wellchild awards 2023, in association with gsk at the hurlingham club, london winner poppy higham with prince harry 79 2023picture by antony thompson" width=5464 height=8192 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/copy-of-twm-wellchildawards-070923-0050-jpg-64fb22845d3a6.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Antony Thompson/TWM</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Violet Seymour, whom Harry later presented with an Inspirational Child Award, had a giggle with the prince when he asked her if she was a fan of pandas. The six-year-old, who was born with a brain condition and has undergone multiple surgeries over the past five years, was excited to be able to take a giant panda balloon to her home in Poole, but confessed she was actually more into kittens. “We’ll have to find you a different balloon, then,” Harry said to her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Violet’s mother, Holly Kieser, later shared that being at the awards meant “the world” to them, as it was a chance to uplift and praise their special girl. “She’s been through so much, and she has another surgery in a month, but she’s always smiling and happy,” she told Bazaar.com. “We’re a small family, which makes it more of a challenge, as our network is small, but we all help each other and look after her needs.” She added: “It’s fantastic that Harry comes and spends time with everyone. Everyone gets a moment with him, and it makes the day even more special.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Prince Harry also joined 14-year-old Hayley, who has cerebral palsy diplegia and a displaced hip, and has raised over $120,000 for charities. The pair spoke about this year’s Invictus Games in Düsseldorf, as well as Hayley’s own athletic pursuits: wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby. “I’ve no doubt I’ll soon see you [in the Paralympics],” Harry told her. “I’ve watched the Invictus competitions, and it’s great that Harry cares so much about it,” Hayley later told Bazaar. “It’s my dream to compete for Team GB.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite her challenges, Hayley’s upbeat attitude and resilient spirit have made her an inspiration to others around her. “It’s important to me to be able to support others and inspire people,” she said. “I’ve dealt with bullying at school, and that’s been difficult, but I believe in speaking up, not just for myself but also for others.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ruky Anighoro, who has a form of brittle bone disease and has undergone countless procedures and surgeries, was given a special recognition award. But the highlight of his night was showing his rap skills off to Harry. A budding musician, 14-year-old Ruky has already released a single titled “Watch Me Now,” and Harry nodded his head and praised the teen after watching him spit a few impromptu bars. “We’re definitely going to see you in the charts,” Harry told him. Mom Ufuoma later told reporters, “It’s really great that Prince Harry made the visit all the way over from California for this. You can tell he really cares about all of the children. He’s very natural.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There was laughter when Harry joked with Blake McCaughey about taking home the giant tiger balloon next to the boy’s seat. “Never leave a ginger behind,” he told the teenager, who won an Inspirational Young Person trophy. Blake, 15, who has a rare genetic condition that means he cannot eat or drink, delighted the duke with a custom Belfast Giants ice hockey jersey with Harry’s name on the back and the number 84 to reflect his birth year, plus a bottle of Giants Basalt Rock Gin.</p><img alt="wellchild awards 2023, in association with gsk, held at the hurlingham club, london 7 september 2023picture by andrew higgins" title="wellchild awards 2023, in association with gsk, held at the hurlingham club, london 7 september 2023picture by andrew higgins" width=1800 height=1201 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/copy-of-twm-wellchildawards-070923-1012-jpg-64fb24c4beed5.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Andrew Higgins/Thousand Word Media Ltd</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mom Christine told Bazaar of meeting Harry, “He was so down to earth. I wasn’t nervous about meeting him. He’s very much on your level and just very good with Blake, asking him about himself but also wishing him well and asking why he was in the hospital and what the food was like—which Blake told him was crap.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During their chat, Harry warned Blake’s family that it would be an emotional night, but was told that Blake himself was “the emotional one.” Harry added, “It’s good to cry.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Other winners of the evening included 11-year-old George Hall, who has severe health problems, meaning he has a tracheotomy, pacemaker, and complete heart block. His courage saw him receive an Inspiration Child Award. Harry later commented that the bravery of all of the children present was extremely humbling, particularly for a father of two healthy children.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“As a father of two—and three dogs, so basically five—I’m acutely aware of the many joys and challenges that come with parenting,” he said. “And that’s with kids who aren’t facing health challenges. So to the parent carers in the room, you have my sincerest admiration and respect. The level of support and responsibility you share daily is unrivaled and without fail. You deserve all the assistance you need—whether it’s training enough skilled carers to help shoulder the increasing demands of 24/7 care routines or simply providing time and space for you to take a break once in a while. It is our collective responsibility to continue to provide new and existing resources for you, to advocate on your behalf, and to help in any way we can. You are proof that not all superheroes wear capes!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And this Friday, Prince Harry visited St. George’s Chapel in Windsor, where he privately paid his respects to Queen Elizabeth on the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a45037319/king-charles-honors-queen-elizabeth-ii-portrait-death-anniversary/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="anniversary of her death" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">anniversary of her death</a>. The duke was photographed by a passerby leaving his grandmother’s resting place. Later in the day, he will travel to Düsseldorf, where he will stay until September 16 for the 2023 Invictus Games—the sporting event he founded for wounded, sick, and injured veterans and service people.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Prince William and Princess Kate also honored the late queen <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a45047721/prince-william-kate-middleton-queen-elizabeth-death-anniversary/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="at a service today" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">at a service today</a>, and King Charles III shared a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a45037319/king-charles-honors-queen-elizabeth-ii-portrait-death-anniversary/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="touching statement" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">touching statement</a> remembering his mother.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/45770d72-fac8-4474-90bb-36e121ad9a67_1543445615.jpeg alt="Headshot of Omid Scobie" title="Headshot of Omid Scobie" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Omid Scobie is <a href=#>BAZAAR.com</a>’s Royal Editor at Large and has covered the lives and philanthropic work of the younger members of the British Royal Family for over eight years.
