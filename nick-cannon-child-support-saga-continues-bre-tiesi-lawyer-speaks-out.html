They are <strong>Monroe, Moroccan, Golden Sagon, Powerful Queen, Zion Mixolydian, Zillion Heir, Legendary Love, Onyx Ice, Rise Messiah, Beautiful Zeppelin</strong>, and <strong>Halo Marie</strong>.

Or because he is who he is, they could say, 'We know you can afford X amount for each household.'"</p><p id=e9VaL_WzV_M data-wc=30>However, her lawyer Neama Rahmani has called out her client's claims as "absolutely not true," and even told her via an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Us Weekly</a>: <strong>"Bre, you should know better!"</strong></p><p id=ePp1NCDmu5O data-wc=17><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Nick Cannon's insane birthday party for 12-year-old twins – and you'll never believe what he did</a></strong></p><p id=ePWNvfWdNv2 data-wc=34>She explained: "There's no cap on child support based on the number of children.

And Nick is not my sugar daddy."</strong></p><p id=eMHXvWFe0kTS data-wc=45>She added: "Nick is not my reason that I'm where I'm at – he's none of these things. It's stupid. I can make crazy money by myself. I can carry my lifestyle, which is not cheap. I can carry my child and my own [expletive]."</p><p id=e9T9qxf7cob2 data-wc=40>Her lawyer did maintain that part of what she said on the show was of course true, and defended her with: "Bre is a successful actress, model and real estate agent.
