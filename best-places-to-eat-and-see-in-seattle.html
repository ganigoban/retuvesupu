I have dreamed about going to Seattle for as long as I can remember. Here’s the thing….since I live in a place where it is perpetually sunny, I actually crave overcast days, rain, and tall green trees. Give me all of the Seattle weather — for a few days! Since I have been planning a trip to Seattle for so long, I have been doing an extensive amount of research. I have great friends who live there – Lisa and Ali who gave me fabulous suggestions. I even have a wonderful reader, Cynthia, who reached out to me as well to give her suggestions. I love to talk to the locals because they definitely know the good places.</p><p>I have compiled the ultimate list of the <strong>BEST PLACES TO EAT AND SEE IN SEATTLE.</strong> This will include things to do in Seattle and the most popular places to eat.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_3779-copy.jpg alt="Pink peonies at Pike Place Market.

It is part of the quintessential Seattle experience. The flying fish, the gorgeous flowers, the amazing food makes it a must see. &nbsp;You want to arrive early in the day to beat the crowds. &nbsp;We went twice — once in the afternoon and once in the morning, as soon as they opened. The afternoon was swarming with people but in the morning, the crowds were much lighter. &nbsp;There are several food options there so scroll down below for food recommendations.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_0378-copy.jpg alt="Pike Place Market.

We visited the beautiful, scenic Whidbey Island and loved taking in the beauty of it. &nbsp;There is so much to see and do yet we were able to get almost everything in within one day. &nbsp;We took our rental van over on the ferry with us and it was quite reasonable. The kids thoroughly enjoyed the ferry ride experience as well.</p><p>Bainbridge Island is the closest island to Seattle so it’s very popular for tourists. &nbsp;If you visit Bainbridge Island, visit Blodel gardens and eat at the Oak Table. &nbsp;Don’t miss ice cream at Mora Iced Creamery.</p><p>If you have time, definitely visit the San Juan Islands, specifically the Orcas. It is timeless beauty and awe-inspiring greenery.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_0609-copy-1.jpg alt="Whidbey Pies Cafe on Whidbey Island.

There is berry picking all over the small farming towns surrounding Seattle. We even found some farms on Whidbey Island.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_0943-copy.jpg alt="Berry Picking in Carnation Washington at Remlinger Farm.

Chism Beach Park is set on a hill covered in green grass, and surrounded by pine trees and fresh flowers. It is fresh lake water so it can be nice and chilly. You can put out a blanket or beach towels on the grass and enjoy the views.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_0958-copy-1.jpg alt="Chism Beach Park.
