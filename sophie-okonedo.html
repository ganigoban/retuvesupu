<time>27 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><h2>Early life</h2><p id=eqqF8Bo2Df data-wc=46>Her journey from respected stage and TV actress to Academy Award nominee has not always been an easy one. Born in London on 1 January 1969, to Henry, a Nigerian father a government worker, and fitness instructor Joan, Sophie was just five when her parents separated.</p><p id=eTEVLbVKu1 data-wc=40>Following the break-up, her father returned to Nigeria and the youngster grew up in the care of her mother. Though a good student and voracious reader, Sophie left school at 16 to work on a clothing stall at Portobello Market.</p><h2>Career start</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/84129f9d6c24-sophie-okonedo-sags.jpg><p id=eZmTTGFYMv data-wc=75>Two years later she found her way into acting in a roundabout way after joining a writers' group headed by Oscar-nominated Hanif Kureishi, who received an Academy nod for the screen play of his novel <i>My Beautiful Laundrette.</i> It did not take Sophie long to discover she lacked the drive to be a writer and, feeling that her abilities lay in a different direction, she enrolled at London's prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).</p><p id=eWTN45sU8Ac data-wc=47>"I quickly realised I was better at reading out other people's bits than I was at the writing. So I got in a play, and then I auditioned for the Royal Academy and got a scholarship there," she say, reflecting on her attempts at being a writer.</p><p id=eGcywypZOY data-wc=55>As a young actress fresh out of drama school, Sophie parlayed her raw talent and confidence into stage roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Young Vic and the National Theatre. She also cut her teeth on the small screen, landing parts in UK television dramas such as <i>Sweet Revenge</i>, <i>Clocking Off</i> and <i>White Teeth</i>.</p><p id=ex-hNYenP7E data-wc=31>However, it was her edgy and provocative interpretation of Cressida in Trevor Nunn's 1999 London production of Shakespeare's <i>Troilus And Cressida</i> which brought enormous critical acclaim and really got her noticed.</p><h2>Film career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6813786b6077-sophie-okonedo-evening-standard.jpg><p id=eFvZjSMMaAB data-wc=53>While concentrating her efforts on stage acting, she had also scored cameos in a handful of Hollywood productions, including <i>Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls</i> and <i>The Jackal</i>. But it would be in Stephen Frears' 2002 dark thriller <i>Dirty Pretty Things</i>, playing a compassionate prostitute, that she would prove herself as a talented lead.</p><p id=eSfobLCYQBm data-wc=47>"I went around and saw Stephen Frears last week and said: 'I really have to kiss your feet. Thank you very much because you've given me a career I never expected," Sophie said. "I was quite happily doing theatre and a bit of TV for extra money."</p><p id=ef-ijbf6ga data-wc=80>The respected theatre actress was suddenly a movie star and found herself on the receiving end of a slew of film offers. But it would be Terry George's <i>Hotel Rwanda</i> that captured her imagination. The film tells the story of a hotelier heralded as the Oscar Schindler of Rwanda's bloody conflict after he saved over 1,200 Tutsis from ethnic cleansing. Sophie's spellbinding interpretation of the hotelier's wife, won her both critical plaudits and an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress.</p><p id=eU3gblX-cxX data-wc=43>Sophie says her Academy nod took her completely by surprise. "I was busy minding my own business and I just didn't think about a nomination," she confessed. "I was just hoping the film would get recognised so people would go and see it."</p><h2>Continuing career</h2><p id=ej9fozaH6D data-wc=54>Although becoming a hugely successful movie star, stage is still Sophie's passion and in 2023, the actress returned to the stage in Medea, playing the title role. On-screen, she has appeared in hit films like Christopher Robin, Hellboy and Death on the Nile,&nbsp;while her TV roles have included Flack&nbsp;and His Dark Materials.</p><h2>Personal life</h2><p id=ejCVufR52n data-wc=88>Sophie is trying to find a balance between a burgeoning film career, remaining loyal to the stage and her family life with partner Eoin Martin and their daughter Aoife. Indeed, Sophie says the hardest part of being a film star is not being around for her daughter. "With theatre I'm home every night before bedtime. It's tough when my child is in the middle of school - I hate pulling her out - but I also hate her not being with me. It's a working mother's typical dilemma."</p><p id=eOWy89JdOP data-wc=51>But the busy actress also insists she is slowly getting acclimatised to other aspects of life in the Hollywood limelight. "When I was younger, I would have been appalled at all the dress stuff and the red carpets," she explains. "But now I'm more relaxed and find it an absolute hoot."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9saGZkwLC8x6KcZqebpLumsM5o</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsophie-okonedo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsophie-okonedo.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsophie-okonedo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsophie-okonedo.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsophie-okonedo.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsophie-okonedo.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./super-mario-bros-wonder-black-friday-nintendo-switch-online-deal-sale.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./super-mario-bros-wonder-black-friday-nintendo-switch-online-deal-sale.html>Super Mario Bros.
