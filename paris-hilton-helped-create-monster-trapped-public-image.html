<time>21 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>THE world knows her as a ditzy, party-loving heiress.</strong></p><p>But behind Paris Hilton’s glamorous life lies a dark past — including claims she was abused as a teenager — according to a new documentary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000606941693.jpg><p>The 105-minute YouTube film also explores the horror she felt at the leak of her infamous 2003 sex tape.</p><p>It also describes how she feels trapped by the public image she has sculpted, as she claims: “I feel like I helped create a monster.”</p><p>In the documentary, This Is Paris, the 39-year-old socialite alleges she was physically and emotionally abused — including enduring beatings and solitary confinement — after being sent to boarding school.</p><p>She also describes how she has been abused by five old boyfriends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000605680589-1.jpg><p>She tells the camera: “I feel like the whole world thinks they know me because I’ve been playing this character for so long.</p><p>“No one really knows who I am. Something happened in my childhood that I’ve never talked about with anyone. I still have nightmares about it.</p><p>“I wish I could bring a camera into my dreams and show you what it’s like. It’s terrifying and I relive that every night.</p><p>“I experienced it and to this day I’m still traumatized.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/78790422-9987-4bf3-8b2d-eb6c21bc5f82.jpg><p>“I’m so used to playing a character that it’s hard for me to be normal. When the camera’s around I always turn into someone else.”</p><p>Paris’s big break came in 2003 reality show The Simple Life, when she and socialite Nicole Richie, 38, were filmed attempting and failing to live and work on a farm.</p><p>Born the eldest of four children to parents, Kathy, 61, and Rick, 65, the chairman of the Hilton hotel chain, Paris seemed destined for fame.</p><p>Her parents nicknamed her Star, told her she was going to be the next Marilyn Monroe and sent her for etiquette lessons in New York.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/7e08cbff-7672-42dd-b8eb-7ddea186ff92.jpg><p>She reveals: “My mum wanted me to be a Hilton...and I just wanted to be Paris.”</p><p>In footage from her heyday, a fan is seen taking a picture with her and ignoring her then little-known pal . . . Kim Kardashian.</p><p>Kim, 39, now married to rapper Kanye West, 43, tells the documentary: “I wouldn’t be here today if it hadn’t been for, number one, her starting off in the reality world and her introducing me to the world.”</p><p>The interviews come between shots of Paris — now a businesswoman with 19 different sidelines and worth £228million — touring the globe to DJ and promote her products.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000291262895.jpg><p>It is here we see vintage Paris, boasting she travels 250 days a year and that her fragrances have raked in more than $3billion.</p><p>She is also seen accidentally dropping more than $3,000 out of her handbag during a trip to Seoul, South Korea</p><p>Later, her social media strategist, Brit Sheeraz Hasan, 46, barks at her: “We get you in bed now, you sleep. Hair and glam, ready 8am.”</p><p>But at 2am she is lying awake in her hotel room and says: “I travel all around the world and I’ve seen nothing except hotel room, clubs, stores.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/e6b97df2-66b5-46a3-9c4d-d1916127ae80.jpg><p>“I don’t even know who I am sometimes. I’m always kind of putting on this facade.</p><p>“I just had this plan and created this brand and this persona and this character and I’ve been stuck with her ever since.</p><p>“Everyone says I’m the original influencer, but sometimes I feel like I helped create a monster.”</p><p>Her sister Nicky, 36, adds: “Her brand is a lot more glamorous than she is. She’s a chick who likes to scrap up at home with her dogs, eat leftovers — she’s very normal.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000516872104.jpg><p>When it comes to having a normal life with a family, Paris vows only to slow down once she becomes a billionaire.</p><p>She says: “At least I had my eggs frozen. I definitely want to have a girl first and name her London, but I just don’t know when I’m going to have time.</p><p>"I will not stop until I make a billion dollars. Then I think I can relax.”</p><p>On the prospect of men in her life, she is not that hopeful, saying: “Unless you’re going to have some bitch boy following me around like they always do and I lose all respect for them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000558651726.jpg><p>“I’m freaked out by people, especially men.”</p><p>Part of that goes back to the release of a sex tape showing Paris in bed with then-boyfriend Rick Salomon, a poker player.</p><p>In archive footage, Rick, now 52, is shown appealing for viewers to watch the video, called 1 Night In Paris.</p><p>Paris denies claims she leaked the tape herself and says she was pressured into making it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000605680596-1.jpg><p>Choking back tears, she says: “That was a private moment with a teenage girl not in her right head space. But everyone was watching it and laughing, like it’s something funny.</p><p>“If that happened today it would not be the same story at all. But they made me the bad person. Like I did something bad.</p><p>“It was my first real relationship. Eighteen. I was so in love with him and I wanted to make him happy.</p><p>“And I just remember him pulling out the camera. And he was kind of pressuring me into it. It was like being electronically raped.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/8d2fca5f-46fa-4641-a9a2-037875700453.jpg><p>Sister Nicky adds: “I think one of her biggest struggles is trust. She’s been betrayed so many times.”</p><p>Wary Paris is shown installing hidden cameras around her home when boyfriend Aleks Novakovic, an influencer, visits.</p><p>She explains: “I’m doing this because I have a new boyfriend who is going to be here when I’m gone. I want to know what’s happening when I’m not here.”</p><p>He passes the test, but does not last long on Paris’s arm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000605680601-1.jpg><p>The pair split after they are filmed having a boozy bust-up at a music festival in Belgium in July 2019, minutes before Paris is due on stage to DJ.</p><p>Aleks is shown complaining about her doing interviews, adding: “I won’t stress you out but you left me five times today.”</p><p>The pair get into a blazing row, before Paris tells her team: “He needs to chill the f*** out. I’m sick of this s**t.”</p><p>Later in the film she reveals that five of her previous boyfriends have physically abused her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/0f4f1054-cf9a-4c12-b78d-f1a83824742c.jpg><p>As pictures show her with a bruised arm, she says: “I’ve had worse stuff happen — been strangled and phones thrown at me, computers.</p><p>"I’ve been in a lot of relationships where people get so controlling and get so angry that they become physical. And I accepted it because I almost thought it was normal.</p><p>"I just wanted love so bad that I was willing to accept being hit or yelled at or screamed or strangled.”</p><p>All these things, Paris claims, can be traced back to her childhood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000571763854.jpg><p>Her parents struggled to control her wild behaviour as a teen and sent her to various boot camp-style programmes.</p><p>Describing how she fled from one “emotional growth” camp, Paris says: “The guys that worked at the camp grabbed us . . . And then they literally just beat the hell out of us in front of everyone.”</p><p>But it was being taken from her bed one night and sent to Provo Canyon, a boarding school in Utah, that haunts her most.</p><p>She reveals: “I’m scared to go to bed at night. I always have this recurring nightmare.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000605680588.jpg><p>"I’m in bed and these two people come into my room and say, ‘Do you want this to happen the easy way or the hard way?’. I try and just run.”</p><p>During 11 months at Provo, Paris claims she was physically and emotionally tortured and put in solitary confinement.</p><p>She says: “You’re sitting on a chair staring at a wall all day long. Getting yelled at or hit.</p><p>“I felt like a lot of the people who worked there got off on torturing children and seeing them naked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000606942455.jpg><p>“I got into so much trouble. Solitary confinement.</p><p>"They’d make people take their clothes off and go in there for 20 hours.</p><p>"I felt like I was going crazy.</p><p>“I was just freezing, I was starving. I was alone, I was scared.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NINTCHDBPICT000572163627.jpg><p>"The only thing that saved my sanity was thinking about what I wanted to do and who I wanted to become when I got out of there.</p><p>"I was going to do everything in my power to be so successful that my parents could never control me again.”</p><p>Other ex-pupils tell similar horror stories, as it emerges that between 2011 and 2014 police responded to 56 calls for assault at the centre and 25 regarding sexual offences.</p><p>As Paris opens up to mum Kathy about the abuse for the first time, Kathy breaks down in tears and hugs her daughter.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>She says: “Had I known this, you know that Dad and I would have been there in one second.”</p><p>But does confronting her demons mean Paris is now ready to split from her brands and take The Simple Life at last?</p><p>“No,” she jokes. “It’ll be an expensive divorce. I’ll just be like this for ever.”</p><ul><li><strong>This Is Paris is available on YouTube from September 14</strong></li></ul><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Paris Hilton breaks down in tears and says she's so used to 'playing a character' she doesn't know how to be 'normal'</span><p><strong>GOT a story?
