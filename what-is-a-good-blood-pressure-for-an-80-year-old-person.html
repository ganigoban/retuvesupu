But if you're 60 or older, the target has moved up: Your goal is to keep your blood pressure at 150/90 or lower. If you have kidney disease or diabetes, your target used to be 130/80 or lower; now it's 140/90 or lower.<h2>What should a 85 year old blood pressure?</h2>When treating hypertension in patients over the age of 85 years, the usual target blood pressure is 150/80 mmHg for reduction of the risk of stroke, heart attack, and other cardiovascular events.<h2>What is a normal blood pressure reading for an 80 year old male?</h2>The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend a systolic blood pressure of no higher than 130 milligrams of mercury (mmHg) for those over 65.<h2>Intensive Blood Pressure Control in Adults Aged 75 Years or Older</h2><p></p><h2>What is normal blood pressure for an 82 year old?</h2>Normal blood pressure for most adults is defined as a systolic pressure of less than 120 and a diastolic pressure of less than 80.<h2>What should blood pressure be at 83?</h2>This is what your diastolic blood pressure number means: Normal: Lower than 80. Stage 1 hypertension: 80-89. Stage 2 hypertension: 90 or more.<h2>Is 150 90 A good blood pressure?</h2>Normal blood pressure: Less than 120/80 mmHg. Prehypertension: 120-139/80-89 mmHg. Stage I hypertension: 140-159/90-99 mmHg. Stage II hypertension: 160/100 mmHg or higher.<h2>What is stroke level blood pressure?</h2>A hypertensive crisis is a severe increase in blood pressure that can lead to a stroke. Extremely high blood pressure — a top number (systolic pressure) of 180 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or higher or a bottom number (diastolic pressure) of 120 mm Hg or higher — can damage blood vessels.<h2>What is too high blood pressure for elderly?</h2>The previous guidelines set the threshold at 140/90 mm Hg for people younger than age 65 and 150/80 mm Hg for those ages 65 and older. This means 70% to 79% of men ages 55 and older are now classified as having hypertension. That includes many men whose blood pressure had previously been considered healthy.<h2>What time of day is blood pressure highest?</h2>Usually, blood pressure starts to rise a few hours before you wake up. It continues to rise during the day, peaking in midday. Blood pressure normally drops in the late afternoon and evening. Blood pressure is normally lower at night while you're sleeping.<h2>When is the best time to take your blood pressure?</h2>Measure your blood pressure twice daily.<p>The first measurement should be in the morning before eating or taking any medications, and the second in the evening. Each time you measure, take two or three readings to make sure your results are accurate.</p><h2>Is 160 over 80 a good blood pressure?</h2>Normal pressure is 120/80 or lower. Your blood pressure is considered high (stage 1) if it reads 130/80. Stage 2 high blood pressure is 140/90 or higher. If you get a blood pressure reading of 180/110 or higher more than once, seek medical treatment right away.<h2>What is a dangerously low blood pressure for elderly?</h2>Hypotension is abnormally low blood pressure (lower than 90/60 mm Hg). If your blood pressure gets too low, it can cause dizziness, fainting or death. Low blood pressure is not a condition that is usually treated except if it occurs in the elderly or occurs suddenly.<h2>Is 140 over 70 a good blood pressure?</h2>High and Low Blood Pressure<p>The generally accepted standard for “normal” blood pressure is 90/60 to less than120/80. If your blood pressure is consistently lower than 90/60, you have low blood pressure. Blood pressure between 120/80 and 140/90 is still considered normal.</p><h2>How can I bring my blood pressure down immediately?</h2>If you are trying to rapidly lower your blood pressure at home, dial 9-1-1 immediately. You cannot safely treat dangerous high blood pressure at home. Your best move is to lie down flat and calm yourself until emergency help arrives.<h2>Which number is more important in blood pressure?</h2>For years, systolic blood pressure has been seen as the one that really matters. That's based on studies -- including the famous Framingham Heart Study -- showing that high systolic blood pressure is a stronger predictor of heart disease and stroke.<h2>What if my blood pressure is 147 over 93?</h2>high blood pressure is considered to be 140/90mmHg or higher (or 150/90mmHg or higher if you're over the age of 80) ideal blood pressure is usually considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg.<h2>Does 140 80 require medication?</h2>120 to 129/less than 80 (Elevated): You probably don't need medication. 130/80 to 139/89 (stage 1 hypertension): You might need medication. 140/90 or higher (stage 2 hypertension): You probably need medication.<h2>Is 110/60 too low blood pressure?</h2>A blood pressure reading of 110/60 mmHg is usually not considered a low blood pressure. Many people may have this reading without developing any signs and symptoms. The upper number (numerator) in the reading indicates the systolic pressure, whereas the lower number (denominator) represents the diastolic pressure.<h2>Is 135 75 A good blood pressure?</h2>Under the current guidelines: Normal: Less than 120/80. Elevated: Systolic between 120-129 and diastolic less than 80. Stage 1 hypertension: Systolic between 130-139 or diastolic between 80-89.<h2>Is 110 80 A good blood pressure?</h2>A normal blood pressure for an adult is defined as 90 to 119 systolic over 60 to 79 diastolic. The range between 120 to 139 systolic and 80 to 89 diastolic is called pre-hypertension, and readings above that indicate hypertension, or high blood pressure.<h2>Is 110/70 A good blood pressure?</h2>For a young, healthy adult, normal blood pressure is about 110/70, but generally, the lower your blood pressure is, the better. If you have a reading of 140/90 or more, you have high blood pressure, also known as hypertension.<h2>What blood pressure is too low?</h2>Low blood pressure is generally considered a blood pressure reading lower than 90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) for the top number (systolic) or 60 mm Hg for the bottom number (diastolic).<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lmah6onnGqKadZZKhvLCwjKmpnqujqr%2BmecWoqWaZnmKFcXnYnpirZZ%2BhsW68xKuqqKY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-a-good-blood-pressure-for-an-80-year-old-person.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-a-good-blood-pressure-for-an-80-year-old-person.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-a-good-blood-pressure-for-an-80-year-old-person.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-a-good-blood-pressure-for-an-80-year-old-person.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-a-good-blood-pressure-for-an-80-year-old-person.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-a-good-blood-pressure-for-an-80-year-old-person.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-heidi-powell-dating-now-past-relationship-current-relationship-status-rumours-and-facts-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-heidi-powell-dating-now-past-relationship-current-relationship-status-rumours-and-facts-html.html>Who is Heidi Powell Dating Now?-Past Relationship, Current Relationship Status, Rumours, and Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./travis-kelce-drinking-rumors-reaction.html>Travis Kelce Reacts to Drinking Rumors: Report</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./travis-kelce-drinking-rumors-reaction.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
