Over the course of his four decades in the entertainment business, the American actor has been in more than 120 TV shows.</p><p>He has also been in movies and TV shows like American Odyssey, Everwood, The Congressman, In the Blood, The Hideout, and many others. Stories about what he has done in the entertainment business are interesting and never end. Williams’ wife and kids are another thing that has gotten people interested in him.</p><h2>In this article, we’ll look at Treat Williams’s personal life</h2><p>Treat Williams is married to Pam Van Sant, who is also his wife.</p><p>Since June 25, 1988, Treat Williams has been married to Pam Van Sant, an American actress and producer. They’ve been together for more than 30 years, and they plan to be together for many more.</p><p>She was born in the United States on February 10, 1955. In 1985, she was in the documentary American Masters, for which she also got credit as an assistant producer. The documentary seems to be the only thing the famous person’s spouse has done in the entertainment business.</p><p>It seems that Van Sant worked as a waitress in a restaurant in New York, which is where she met Williams. Before they got married, they were together for about a year. In 2017, there was a crazy rumor that they had broken up, which was later proven to be false. The two people are still together and live in Park City, Utah, now.</p><h2>Treat Williams and Pam Van Sant have had two kids outside of marriage</h2><p>Williams and Van Sant have had children for more than thirty years. Gille and Ellie are the couple’s children.</p><p>Their oldest child, Gill Williams, was born in 1992, and their youngest, Elinor Williams, was born in 1998. Since both of their kids are already adults, Treat and Pam must have gotten out from under the responsibility of being parents.</p><p>Many of Treat’s movies have screenings where the whole family can be seen. There isn’t much information about Gill and Elinor on the Internet. But if you go to his Instagram page, which is called @treat.williams2 and has a lot of pictures of his kids, you can see them all.</p><h2>Treat Williams is worth a lot of money</h2><p>Celebrity Net Worth says that the 70-year-old actor is worth $10 million. He made money by acting on stage, in movies, and on TV, and by writing books for children. He also has a pilot’s license and works as a flight instructor, both of which add to his net worth.</p><p>Williams has been in many TV shows, such as Tales from the Crypt, Everwood, Brothers and Sisters, and others. He has also been on stage as Danny Zuko in the play Grease, a pirate in the play Pirates of Penzance, and Manuel in the musical Captains Courageous, to name a few. In “Deadly Hero,” which came out in 1976, he played Billings for the first time.</p><p>Williams was an actor, but he also wrote books for children. His first book was a story for kids ages three to seven about an air show. It was written in simple language and had bright pictures.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrHDmpummpqisG%2B1zWiuoaddnsBuwNGemK1lp565rbXApqpmr5mbsm68wKZkr5meYsCiutNo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-treat-williams-wife-pam-van-sant.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-treat-williams-wife-pam-van-sant.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-treat-williams-wife-pam-van-sant.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-treat-williams-wife-pam-van-sant.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-treat-williams-wife-pam-van-sant.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-treat-williams-wife-pam-van-sant.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-are-crawfish-cooked-alive.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-are-crawfish-cooked-alive.html>Why are crawfish cooked alive?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-somo-dating-now-past-relationships-current-status-and-rumours-html.html>Who is SoMo Dating Now? | Past Relationships, Current Relationship Status, Rumours, and Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-somo-dating-now-past-relationships-current-status-and-rumours-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
