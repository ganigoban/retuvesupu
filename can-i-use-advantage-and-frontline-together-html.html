<time>21 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-138 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span><b>Answer</b></span></p><p>Here are a few instances of commonly prescribed drugs that should never be used together: Frontline Plus should not be used in conjunction with Advantage II; Advantage Multi should not be used in conjunction with Revolution; and Advantage Multi should not be used in conjunction with any other drugs, with the exception of Capstar or the Preventic collar.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>As a result, how soon can I reapply another flea treatment treatment?</h3><p>In most cases, the optimal period for reapplication is between two and three weeks following the first treatment. After that, wait another 1-2 weeks before submitting another application. Flea pupae may not hatch for many weeks or months if the weather is chilly.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is it possible to mix flea treatments?</h3><p>&nbsp;In general, it is not a good idea to mix two flea treatments since dogs are healthier when they are exposed to fewer chemicals. Using more than one product on a pet indicates that there is an issue with environmental control measures both inside and outside the house, which is why several products are needed.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible to use Advantage flea treatment as early as possible?</h3><p>Yes, if the flea treatment you used doesn’t work after two weeks, you may reapply it or move to a different kind of therapy. Advantage or Revolution are the programmes I suggest.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is Frontline’s effectiveness eroding as time passes?</h3><p>Keep in mind that every flea and tick prophylactic medication is efficient in eradicating 95 to 98 percent of parasites, but the young fleas are still unaffected by these treatments. As a result, it is suggested to use Frontline Plus in conjunction with a short-term flea treatment such as Capstar to ensure that all fleas are killed.</p><p></p><h3>There were 37 related questions and answers found.</h3><p></p><h3>What happens if you put flea treatment on too soon after getting fleas?</h3><p>If you discover fleas on your pet after using your pet’s topical flea medication, you may want to consider reapplying it as soon as you discover them. However, this method is not always suggested and, in certain rare instances, may result in an overdose of the drug. When most flea preventions are overdosed, the following side effects may occur: Drooling in copious amounts.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is it possible to renew for Frontline before the 30-day period?</h3><p>FRONTLINE Plus is effective for 30 days, regardless of whether or not your pet swims or is washed during that time. Keep your pet out of the water for at least 24 hours after applying the product. If FRONTLINE Plus is to be used after a bath, be certain that your pet is totally dry before applying the treatment.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible to give a dog too much flea treatment?</h3><p>Diarrhea, vomiting, trouble breathing, tiny pupils, muscular tremor, weakness or falling over are all indicators of poisoning caused by flea treatments containing organophosphates. Drooling is another sign of toxicity. Organophosphate poisoning may be lethal within minutes or hours, depending on the chemicals and amount that the pet is exposed to.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Is it permissible to take flea medication twice in a single month?</h3><p>I do not advocate using it more than twice in a single month. If you are worried about ticks, Frontline is a more elegant product in my opinion. One thing I would say about K9 Advantix is that it is effective. If you have been using it correctly and your dog is still plagued with fleas, then something is wrong with your application process.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible for dogs to acquire fleas again after being treated?</h3><p>Even though the majority of flea treatments only kill adult fleas, fleas may continue to appear for months after you believe your infestation is over. Fleas must be treated on a regular basis in order to be kept at bay, and cleaning your pet will not prevent them from being infected. Even though many adults will be washed away, the eggs will be left behind.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Why does my dog still have fleas despite the fact that I used Frontline?</h3><p>Fleas become hyperactive before they die as a result of a component in FRONTLINE Spot On and FRONTLINE Plus that kills the fleas. There are currently no flea treatments available that prevent fleas from jumping onto dogs. Therefore, regardless of the certified flea treatment you choose, you may still notice fleas on your pet until the flea product kills them.</p><p></p><h3>Is it okay if I apply Frontline every two weeks?</h3><p>Several vets will use the treatment more often than once monthly, sometimes as frequently as once every two to three weeks if the pet continues to have fleas. In spite of the fact that Frontline Plus is marketed as waterproof, I always recommend that my customers wait at least 24 to 48 hours before washing their pets.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>For how long does Frontline’s service take to begin working?</h3><p>For how long does Frontline Plus remain in operation? Frontline Plus kills all fleas and ticks within 18 hours of coming into touch with your pet, and it kills all ticks within 48 hours of coming into contact with your pet, according to the manufacturer. Frontline Plus is effective on the whole body of your pet within 24 hours of application.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible to eliminate fleas in the home with advantage?</h3><p>Using Advantage, you may treat your pet with a spot-on treatment that is simple to administer and kills fleas on contact, eliminating the need for fleas to bite in order to die. It also destroys flea larvae that are present in the residence.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What’s the difference between Advantage and Advantage II, and how can I tell the difference?</h3><p>The original Advantage proved successful in killing adult fleas within 12 hours of treatment, according to the manufacturer. Advantage II continues to give relief from adult fleas in as little as 12 hours, but the new composition now provides an extra layer of protection. Because Advantage II prevents larval fleas from growing, it disrupts the flea lifecycle in its entirety.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible to give a cat too much flea treatment?</h3><p>When a cat is treated immediately after overdosing on medication, there are typically no long-term consequences. It is not recommended that you use another product that contains pyrethrins if you have used a pyrethrin-containing flea and tick treatment that was intended for cats and you are certain that it was administered correctly and your cat still shows indications of toxicity.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>How long does it take for fleas to die after being treated with an insecticide?</h3><p>Despite the fact that adult fleas will be killed within a few days after treatment, the floor should not be cleaned, swept, or washed for at least two weeks following treatment since there will still be eggs on the floor that will hatch.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible to provide benefit more than once a month?</h3><p>Under normal circumstances, this medication is effective for a period of one month. However, in situations of severe flea infestation, retreatment may be required sooner than 4 weeks after the first treatment. For kittens, do not retreat more than once every 14 days, and for small and big cats, do not retreat more than once every 7 days.</p><p></p><h3>What is the maximum number of times you may use Advantage flea treatment?</h3><p>How often should I make use of Advantage? To prevent and cure flea infestations in dogs, it is advised that Advantage be treated every four weeks. It is also recommended that Advantage be applied every four weeks to treat biting lice.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-156 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfo6cmKdlmWLCtLGMmpuvmZ6prqixjJqlnWWWp7yvwMuipZ5lpKS0psDHnqlnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcan-i-use-advantage-and-frontline-together-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcan-i-use-advantage-and-frontline-together-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcan-i-use-advantage-and-frontline-together-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcan-i-use-advantage-and-frontline-together-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcan-i-use-advantage-and-frontline-together-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcan-i-use-advantage-and-frontline-together-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./catherine-siachoque-net-worth-income-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./catherine-siachoque-net-worth-income-html.html>Catherine Siachoque Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./camilla-parker-bowles-explains-her-long-term-covid-19-side-effects.html>Camilla Parker Bowles Explains Her Long-Term COVID-19 Side Effects</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./camilla-parker-bowles-explains-her-long-term-covid-19-side-effects.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
