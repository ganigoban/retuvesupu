It's only when live ones are not available that they're cooked dead and/or frozen. Freezing doesn't help the texture of any of them, but it particularly damages lobster, making the flesh watery. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>Is it inhumane to boil crawfish?</h2>Like all animals, crayfish want to live, and when left alone in their natural homes, they can do so for 30 years. We may not be able to hear their screams as they're boiled alive, but we can listen to science—scientists have proved beyond any doubt that crayfish, fish, lobsters, crabs, and other sea animals feel pain. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on peta.org</a><h2>Why aren't lobsters killed before cooking?</h2>Lobsters and other shellfish have harmful bacteria naturally present in their flesh.

The short answer is no. Even in other species like the spiny lobsters (family Palinuridae) where males go out looking for females, they do not form pair bonds.
