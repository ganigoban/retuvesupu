For years I tried to do just that to no avail.</p><p>"So I went online, set up my meal plan, stuck to it religiously, and started to put in the work. I feel I got into the best shape of my life for it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NINTCHDBPICT000588923055.jpg><h2>REY MYSTERIO</h2><p>For the most part of his career, Mysterio was known as a tiny, skinny high-flyer, flipping and spinning his way around the ring.</p><p>But it was his comeback to Vince McMahon's promotion in 2018 that shocked fans the most.</p><p>The biggest change came in his physique, with toned abs, a ripped body and bulking arms - and he still remains in great shape right now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SPORT-PREVIEW-rey-body.jpg><h2>SETH ROLLINS</h2><p>When Rollins first made a name for himself on the independent scene under the name 'Tyler Black' he did so as a skinny yet technical wrestler.</p><p>But as he burst onto the the WWE scene with The Shield in 2012, the development in his body was starting to show as he appeared heavier in his upper body.</p><p>Rollins has gone on to become one of the promotion's biggest stars becoming more ripped as he broke out as a singles competitor with fans desperate for the Monday Night Messiah's return.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Seth-Rollins-1.jpg><h2>DREW McINTYRE</h2><p>At 6ft 5in McIntyre has always been an imposing figure.</p><p>But after he was released from the WWE in 2014 only to return three years later, he did so in monstrous shape, evidently more ripped this time around.</p><p>McIntyre credits the success during his second stint with the WWE on taking his career more seriously.</p><p>And his hard work is currently being rewarded as he held the WWE title up until the Elimination Chamber in February.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NINTCHDBPICT000588923059.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in wwe</h2></p><h2>ROMAN REIGNS</h2><p><span>WWE star Roman Reigns sent fans wild by debuting his new look at last year's Clash of Champions.</span></p><p><span>The Big Dog -

who captured the Universal Title within a week of his return at SummerSlam - has been synonymous with wearing a vest while wrestling since his Shield debut back in 2012.</span></p><p><span>Yet Reigns stunned fans by going bare-chested for the first time since he was in NXT </span><span>against his cousin Jey Uso</span><span>.</span></p><p><span>The former American football player's new look allowed him to show the </span><span>results of his stunning body transformation last summer.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SPORT-PREVIEW-RR.jpg><h2>BRAY WYATT</h2><p>Wyatt debuted in the WWE as Husky Harris - a chubby and forgettable member of The Nexus.</p><p>But after transforming into Wyatt the American turned his fat into muscle as he filled out.</p><p>He is not a typical ripped WWE star, but instead imposes himself as a bulky bully in the ring.</p><p>And he continues to terrify the WWE Universe as 'The Fiend'.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NINTCHDBPICT000588923061.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Stephanie McMahon's sexy WWE moments</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK570qmmq6xfrMSme5hwa2pxaWTEuLGMm6adsV2pv6K60p%2Bmq6WRqbawutJmqailkaN6s7HIoKWsZaKaxm652KyrnqqZpHw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwwe-body-transformations-roman-reigns-rey-mysterio.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwwe-body-transformations-roman-reigns-rey-mysterio.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwwe-body-transformations-roman-reigns-rey-mysterio.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwwe-body-transformations-roman-reigns-rey-mysterio.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwwe-body-transformations-roman-reigns-rey-mysterio.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwwe-body-transformations-roman-reigns-rey-mysterio.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./not-perfect-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./not-perfect-html.html>Tim Minchin Not Perfect lyrics</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./will-humphrey-net-worth-214763.html>Will Humphrey Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./will-humphrey-net-worth-214763.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
