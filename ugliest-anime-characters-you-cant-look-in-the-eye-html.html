Contrary to the saying that beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, some anime characters have looks that can make even the toughest anime fans cringe. In this list, we’ll introduce you to 19 unforgettable characters from the anime world whose unique appearances have left a lasting impression. Let’s dive into the world of anime’s most unusual faces.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Marechiyo Omaeda – Bleach</strong></h3><p>Marechiyo Omaeda, the Corps Commander of the Patrol Corps in Bleach, is a character whose appearance can be quite a shock. He’s not only extremely obese but also has a peculiar habit of frequently digging his nose. This rotund character, resembling some of the larger-than-life rappers, is loyal to his captain, Soi Fon, but his obsession with wealth and a desire to look extravagant often rub fans the wrong way.</p><h3></h3><h3><strong>&nbsp;Kechizu – Jujutsu Kaisen</strong></h3><p>Kechizu, one of the characters from Jujutsu Kaisen, is a Cursed Womb: Death Painting created as part of a sinister experiment. His grotesque appearance includes a bloated body, two bleeding mouths, and gaping, empty eye sockets. This eerie combination of features is sure to leave viewers speechless and haunted by his unsettling presence.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3></h3><h3><strong>&nbsp;Ishihara – Rainbow</strong></h3><p>In the world of Rainbow, Ishihara is a correctional officer at a juvenile detention center. His appearance deteriorates over time due to his addiction to heroin. As the story unfolds, his character becomes a symbol of disgust and anger, reflecting his sadistic tendencies and the toll of constant drug use. Ishihara’s transformation from a regular officer to a shadow of his former self is a stark reminder of the consequences of addiction.</p><h3></h3><h3><strong>Mino Nenki – Basilisk</strong></h3><p>Mino Nenki, an Iga Tsubagakura ninja in Basilisk, is reminiscent of a humanoid, hairy gorilla. His hair manipulation abilities make him appear even more repellent as he swings from trees like a malevolent monkey. Covered head to toe in messy hair, with sharp ears and teeth resembling those of a wolf, Mino’s appearance is both grotesque and unsettling. Even his formidable eyebrows contribute to his overall eerie presence.</p><h3></h3><h3><strong>&nbsp;Kinnikuman – Seigi Choujin series</strong></h3><p>Suguru Kinniku, the main character in the Seigi Choujin series, possesses a unique appearance characterized by his humongous lips that nearly cover half of his face. While his mother’s love for him remains unwavering, others tend to shy away from him due to his unconventional looks. Despite his lazy and immature demeanor, Kinnikuman is a kind-hearted character who hopes to achieve fame in his own way.</p><h3></h3><h3><strong>&nbsp;Wapol – One Piece</strong></h3><p>Wapol, the ex-king of the Drum Kingdom in One Piece, is a character whose appearance is as eccentric as his personality. Grossly overweight with dark purple hair, Wapol’s cylindrical jaw, adorned with tin plates, sets him apart. His ability to consume his own body while using his main technique is both bizarre and disturbing. Additionally, his choice of attire, including a hooded fur cape, adds to his overall eccentricity.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3></h3><h3><strong>&nbsp;Kaname Tosen (Final Arrancar form) – Bleach</strong></h3><p>Kaname Tosen undergoes a dramatic transformation in Bleach when he unveils his Resurreccion: Suzumushi Hyakushiki. In this form, he resembles a giant cricket with orange eyes and green pupils. This metamorphosis, driven by his desire to regain his sight, takes a toll on his appearance and ultimately leads to his tragic demise. Tosen’s character serves as a poignant reminder of the consequences of seeking power at any cost.</p><h3></h3><h3><strong>&nbsp;Tange Danpei – Ashita no Joe</strong></h3><p>Tange Danpei, the ex-boxer who mentors Joe in Ashita no Joe, is a character marked by his rugged appearance and problematic drinking habit. With a nose reminiscent of Rudolph the reindeer, Danpei’s life takes a downward spiral after quitting boxing. Despite his unkempt exterior, Danpei’s encounter with the delinquent Joe brings about a change in his life, highlighting the transformative power of friendship.</p><h3><strong>Gluttony – Fullmetal Alchemist – Brotherhood</strong></h3><p>In Fullmetal Alchemist – Brotherhood, Gluttony personifies the sin of gluttony, often feasting on creatures and alchemists. His short, stout, and visibly overweight homunculus form, coupled with a massive nose, bears a resemblance to hippos in the wild. When Gluttony opens his jaw to use his main ability, the sight of his expanding ribs and the unsettling void within is enough to send shivers down viewers’ spines.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Shigaraki Tomura – My Hero Academia</strong></h3><p>Shigaraki Tomura, the main antagonist of My Hero Academia and leader of the League of Villains, possesses a strikingly unsettling appearance. His pale skin, sleep-deprived look, and propensity to scratch himself when agitated contribute to his eerie aura. Tomura’s body is covered by the preserved hands of his deceased family members, including his abusive father’s hand, which shields his face. Despite his tragic past, his actions as a villain are irredeemable, and his sense of fashion leaves much to be desired.</p><h3><strong>Fuusuke of the Wind – The Kishima Thing/Ninku</strong></h3><p>Fuusuke of the Wind from The Kishima Thing/Ninku is a character that defies conventional beauty standards. Despite his scrawny and small stature, his protruding upper lip, big googly eyes, and a giant tongue that often hangs out of his mouth make him resemble a cross between a canine and a primate. However, Fuusuke’s character serves as a reminder that appearances can be deceptive, as he is morally upright and always does what is right, regardless of his unconventional looks.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h3><p>Anime is a medium known for its diverse and unique character designs, and these 19 characters certainly stand out in the world of animation. From grotesque transformations to eccentric features, these characters remind us that beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder. While their appearances may be unconventional, they each contribute to the rich tapestry of storytelling in the anime world, proving that looks aren’t everything.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiaHxxhY6unqWhlajBbq3NoqSeZZOdrrOtwq2cq6tdrry2ecKapa1lnKS8rHnIp2StoJVisrqxjaGrpqQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fugliest-anime-characters-you-cant-look-in-the-eye-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fugliest-anime-characters-you-cant-look-in-the-eye-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fugliest-anime-characters-you-cant-look-in-the-eye-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fugliest-anime-characters-you-cant-look-in-the-eye-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fugliest-anime-characters-you-cant-look-in-the-eye-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fugliest-anime-characters-you-cant-look-in-the-eye-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./amanda-gorman-poem-super-bowl-2021.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./amanda-gorman-poem-super-bowl-2021.html>Watch Inaugural Poet Amanda Gorman's Full Poem from the Super Bowl</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./791886-drake-kendrick-lamar-diss-tupac-ai-response-brother-reaction-hip-hop-news.html>Tupac's Brother Says Drake Went Too Far By Using AI Voice In His Kendrick Lamar Diss Track</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./791886-drake-kendrick-lamar-diss-tupac-ai-response-brother-reaction-hip-hop-news.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
